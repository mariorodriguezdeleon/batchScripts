This batchOFolders.bat file can be ran to create a range of consecutive positive integer numbered folders with sub-directories.


To Run the Program:

1. To create a range of directories, move/copy the file into a manually created "grandparent" directory, or leave the file within this directory.

2. Start a command line console (CLI/CMD), and navigate to the "grandparent" directory.

3. Once at the "grandparent" directory, type the name of the batch file to begin the program. Follow the prompts.


Additional Notes:

To change the names of the sub-directories, open the file in a text editor and change the variables under sub_generate_subFolders.

To Add additional sub-directories, edit the available variables to set names and add the variables to the sub-folder algorithms.
